[0.1.0] Initial release                                             07-Nov-2012
 - Includes substantial infrastructure for defining and invoking arbitrary
   commands, either via the command-line, or via a YAML-based .hfm command
   file.
 - Implementations of commands for Calculation, Document Management, and
   Metadata loads / extracts.

  phased submission groups.

[0.3.1] Bug fixes for Calculation commands                          03-Dec-2012
- Fix bugs introduced to the Calculate module in 0.3.0, due to the adoption of

[0.4.0] Builds for specific HFM versions                            13-Dec-2012
- Due to differences in the type libraries between versions of HFM, it became
  clear that different builds of HFMCmd would be required for each major version
  of HFM, at least under .NET 3.5. Under .NET 4.0, the introduction of the new
  dynamic type functionality provides a possible solution using late-binding of
  COM methods, but this is not yet functional in this release.
- Added an interactive shell mode of operation; to access, just start HFMCmd
  without any parameters. This will drop you at a hfm> prompt, where you can
  then enter commands interactively.

[0.4.1] Added support for 11.1.2.2.300                              12-Dec-2013
- Increased flexability in build process to allow for Patch 30x variants.
- Bug fix for 11.1.2.2.300 where undocumented change to 
  HsvStarSchemaACM.CreateStarSchemaExtDim added a thirteenth parameter,
  includeData (boolean). At this time the value is assumed to be for internal
  use and it has been set as true.
  
[0.4.2] Support for Runtime Variables in YML                        12-Dec-2013
- Implemented runtime variable support for YML files.
