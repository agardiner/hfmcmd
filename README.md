# HFMCmd

HFMCmd is a command-line tool for performing or automating operations in Oracle
Hyperion Financial Management (HFM). It provides a command-line interface for
performing a wide range of repetitive and/or bulk operations on an HFM
application in a simple manner, and facilitates lights out automation of HFM.

HFMCmd uses the published HFM API to perform operations against an HFM
application, but it provides more than just a thin wrapper over the HFM API:
- Where an API function might operate on a single item (e.g. the
  Consolidate API function takes a single Scenario / Year / Entity combination),
  the corresponding command in HFMCmd will typically accept a collection of members
  for each dimension, and automatically manage the looping over each combination.
- Most commands with a large number of parameters provide sensible defaults for
  many parameters. You can consult the online help to determine which parameters
  are required, and which have default values.
- Long-running operations provide progress bars that provide feedback as the
  operation completes.
- Substitution variables can be defined (or environment variables can be used),
  and can then be used virtually anywhere in a command.

In this manner, bulk operations can be performed quickly and easily on large
numbers of scenarios, entities, etc.


## Available Commands

The available commands are continuously being added to, but already there are
commands available for performing most operations associated with:
* Metadata management (e.g. loading / extracting metadata, rules, etc)
* Calculation, consolidation, translation, etc
* Process management (starting, promoting, rejecting, submitting, approving etc)
* Document management (e.g. loading / extracting web forms, reports, etc)

## Downloading Pre-Built Binaries

HFMCmd supports 2 different builds, one for .NET 3.5 and one for .NET 4.0.
Functionally, the two builds are identical; however, the .NET 3.5 builds only
support early binding, which means they must be compiled for a specific version
of HFM. The .NET 4.0 build, on the other hand, utilises the new dynamic
functionality in .NET 4.0, which provides late-binding and allows a single
HFMCmd executable to work with different versions of HFM.

The .NET 4.0 build is the preferred version, but unfortunately .NET 4.0 is not
as widely deployed, and may not be installed on the machine on which you want to
run HFMCmd. In this case, you should choose the .NET 3.5 build for the version
of HFM that you are running.

Pre-built binaries are available at https://github.com/agardiner/hfmcmd/releases.


## Building HFMCmd

As an alternative to downloading pre-built binaries, any machine on which .NET
3.5 or later is installed ought to be able to build HFMCmd from source. This is
as simple as running the appropriate `build_for_<HFM version>.bat` file.


## Installation

HFMCmd is built as a single standalone .EXE file; no installation is required,
simply unzip it to a directory somewhere, and it is ready to run.

### Pre-Requisites

HFMCmd does require an existing installation of the .NET framework, as already
described. It also requires at least a client installation of HFM on the machine
where it is to run.


## Running HFMCmd

HFMCmd supports the following modes of operation:

1.  A single command can be entered on the command-line, along with
    all of the options it requires as keyword arguments, e.g.

    ```
      HFMCmd.exe Consolidate UserName:admin Password:password ClusterName:PROD
          AppName:IFRS Scenario:Actual Year:2008 Periods:May-July Entity:GROUP
    ```

2.  Commands can be read from a command-file specified on the command-line, e.g.

    ```
      HFMCmd.exe consolidate.hfm
    ```

    Contents of consolidate.hfm:

    ```yaml
      SetLogonInfo:
        UserName: admin
        Password: password

      OpenApplication:
        ClusterName: PROD
        AppName: IFRS

      Consolidate:
        Scenario: Actual
        Year: 2008
        Periods: May-July
        Entity: GROUP
    ```
	
	Alternatively runtime variables can be passed in command line for specified
	settings.
	
	```
	HFMCmd.exe consolidate.hfm Year:2012
	```
	
	Contents of consolidate.hfm:

    ```yaml
      SetLogonInfo:
        UserName: admin
        Password: password

      OpenApplication:
        ClusterName: PROD
        AppName: IFRS

      Consolidate:
        Scenario: Actual
        Year:%Year%
        Periods: May-July
        Entity: [GROUP,{LE064.[Base]}]
    ```
	
	In the above example %Year% would be replaced with 2012.
	

3. An interactive shell can be started, where commands can be entered at an hfm>
   prompt. To enter the shell, start HFMCmd with no arguments, i.e.

    ```
      HFMCmd.exe
    ```


## Supported Versions of HFM

HFMCmd has been designed to work with multiple different versions of HFM, and
should work with versions 9.3 through to 11.1.2.2, including support for the new
extended dimensionality in 11.1.2.2.
